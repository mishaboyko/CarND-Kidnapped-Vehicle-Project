   * These associations are needed to calculate the new weight of each particle by using the multi-variate Gaussian probability density function.
   * Finally, normalize these weights to the [0;1] range, cause next you'll use these probabilities for re-sampling.
   * Update the weights of each particle using a multi-variate Gaussian distribution. You can read more about this distribution here:
   *   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution
   * NOTE: The observations are given in the VEHICLE'S coordinate system.
   *   Your particles are located according to the MAP'S coordinate system.
   *   You will need to transform between the two systems. Keep in mind that
   *   this transformation requires both rotation AND translation (but no scaling).
   *   The following is a good resource for the theory:
   *   https://www.willamette.edu/~gorr/classes/GeneralGraphics/Transforms/transforms2d.htm
   *   and the following is a good resource for the actual equation to implement
   *   (look at equation 3.33) http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node99.html
